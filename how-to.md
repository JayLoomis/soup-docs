# How-to

You get a lot of power when you use Beautiful Soup. Sometimes that power comes
with some gotchas or complications. This page is your guide to carefree parsing.

## Changing the parsed tree

Beautiful Soup parses your input HTML into a series of nested objects that
represent the hierarchical structure of an HTML document. You can make changes
to those objects in a variety of ways:




<!--
----|----|10--|----|20--|----|30--|----|40--|----|50--|----|60--|----|70--|----|
-->
