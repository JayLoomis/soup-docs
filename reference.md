## Objects

Beautiful Soup defines four fundamentally important data types:

| Type                                                | Description                                                            |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [**bs4.BeautifulSoup**](#beautifulsoup)             | The core object for an instance of parsed markup, contains the others. |
| [**bs4.element.Tag**](#tag)                         | Represents elements that can contain children.                         |
| [**bs4.element.NavigableString**](#navigablestring) | Represents text elements.                                              |
| [**bs4.element.Comment**](#comment)                 | Like **NavigableString**, but renders with comment tagging in markup.   |

### BeautifulSoup

The **BeautifulSoup** class (**bs4.BeautifulSoup**) represents the markup
document in its entirety. For this purpose 'document' means the element
hierarchy of whatever markup you used when you created an instance of
**BeautifulSoup**.

You can use an object of this class as you would a **Tag** object, with
these exceptions:

-   It doesn't have attributes. Attempting to add an attribute raises a 
    **TypeError**.
-   It doesn't have a name. However, you can access its _name_ property
    without error. It is set to '[document]'.

### Tag

The **Tag** class (**bs4.element.Tag**) is the primary data type used by
Beautiful Soup to represent markup element data. You use the properties and
methods of **Tag** for most navigation of HTML strings.

| Property                                     | Description                                                                                       |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [_attrs_](#tagattrs)                         | A dictionary containing the element's attributes.                                                 |
| [_children_](#tagchildren)                   | An generator to iterate through the direct children of this element.                              |
| [_contents_](#tagcontents)                   | A list of all the direct children of this element.                                                |
| [_name_](#tagname)                           | The name of the element that's represented by the **Tag**.
| [_next_element_](#tagnext_element)           | The next markup element in the source text.                                                       |
| [_next_elements_](#tagnext_elements)         | A generator to iterate through all the following elements.                                        |
| [_next_sibling_](#tagnext_sibling)           | The next markup element with the same parent as this one.                                         |
| [_next_siblings_](#tagnext_siblings)         | A generator to iterate through all the following elements with the same parent as this one.       |
| [_parent_](#tagparent)                       | The tag that directly contains this one.                                                          |
| [_parents_](#tagparents)                     | A generator to iterate through all the ancestors of this element up to the document level.        |
| [_previous_element_](#tagprevious_element)   | The markup element that precedes this one.                                                        |
| [_previous_elements_](#tagprevious_elements) | A generator to iterate through all the preceding elements.                                        |
| [_previous_sibling_](#tagprevious_sibling)   | The previous element with the same parent as this one.                                            |
| [_previous_siblings_](#tagprevious_siblings) | A generator to iterate through all the previous elements with the same parent as this one.        |
| [_string_](#tagstring)                       | The string inside this element, if this element has only one child that is a **NavigableString**. |
| [_strings_](#tagstrings)                     | A generator to iterate through all of the **NavigableString**s in the element.                    |
| [_stripped_strings_](#tagstripped_strings)   | As _strings_, but generates the strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed.             |
| [<_tag name_>](#tagtag-name)                 | The first instance of the specified tag in this element (equivalent to **Tag**.**find**()).       |

#### Tag.attrs

A dictionary containing all of the attributes set for the **Tag**.

The keys are the names of the attributes as they appear in the source text.

If an HTML attribute can have multiple values (most commonly _`class`_),
BeautifulSoup represents its value as a list. This is true even if there is only
a single value for that class in the present instance.

You can also use the **Tag**'s identifier as an alias for _attrs_, using
dictionary key notation with it to get and set values. For example: 

```python
href = tag.attrs['href']
```

Is functionally identical to:

```python
href = tag['href']
```

You can also use **Tag.get**('_key_') to query for an attribute without fear
of raising a **KeyError**.

#### Tag.children

A generator you use to iterate through all of the children of the **Tag**. Each
item returned is another **Tag**, a [**NavigableString**](#navigablestring),
or a [**Comment**](#comment).

Chilren only include elements that are one level deeper in the tree than the
**Tag** within its opening and closing tags&mdash;its direct descendants, if you
will.

You can get a flat list of the **Tag**'s child elements with
[_contents_](#tagcontents).

##### See also

-   [**Tag**](#tag)
-   [_contents_](#tagcontents)

---

#### Tag.contents

A list of all the children of the **Tag**. Each item in the list is another
**Tag**, a [**NavigableString**](#navigablestring), or a
[**Comment**](#comment).

Contents only include elements that are one level deeper in the tree than the
**Tag** within its opening and closing tags&mdash;its direct descendants, if you
will.

You can get a generator to iterate through all the **Tag**'s child elements
with [_children_].

-   [**Tag**](#tag)
-   [_children_](#tagchildren)

---

#### Tag.next_element

The element immediately following the opening tag of the element represented
by the **Tag** object. An element is represented by another **Tag**, a
[**NavigableString**](#navigablestring), or a [**Comment**](#comment).

##### See also

-   [**Tag**](#tag)
-   [_next_elements_](#next_elements)

---

#### Tag.next_elements

A generator you use to interate through all subsequent elements in the 
document. An element is represented by another **Tag**, a
[**NavigableString**](#navigablestring), or a [**Comment**](#comment).

Unlike getting the **Tag**'s children or contents, _next_elements_ gets
every element in the document that comes after the **Tag**. The results are not
limited to elements within the **Tag**. They are given in the order they appear
in the document text without regard for their depth in the hierarchy.

### NavigableString

The **NavigableString** class (**bs4.element.NavigableString**) is 

### Comment

The **Comment** class (**bs4.element.Comment**) is essentially the same thing
as the [**NavigableString**](#navigablestring) class. The only ovious
difference is that when rendered in markup, its text is surrounded by comment
tags (\<\!\-- --\>).

Because **Comment** is a distinct class from both [**Tag**](#tag) and
[**NavigableString**](#navigablestring), you avoid all of the special-case
shenanigans you would have to handle otherwise.
